In other words, for the <b>R</b> code to be recognized, the date format needs to contain a code from the <b>Alternative format</b> list that doesn't appear in the <b>Standard format</b> list.<br /><br />For example, the date format <b>D&nbsp;M&nbsp;Y&nbsp;R</b> will produce <b>13&nbsp;October&nbsp;1797&nbsp;R</b> in English for the date 1797.10.13. If, on the other hand, the date format were <b>j&nbsp;F&nbsp;Y&nbsp;R</b>, the same date would result in <b>13&nbsp;October&nbsp;1797&nbsp;<u>22&nbsp;Vendemiaire&nbsp;An&nbsp;6</u></b> in English.</li></ul>";
