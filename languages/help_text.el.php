Family Tree Maker is the most notorious for this.  <br /><br />The Add Media Tool allows you to keep a list of media links outside of your GEDCOM file and seperate from the normal PhpGedView tables.  Because the data is kept in a seperate table,you only have to enter the data once.  This makes it easy for administrators to work with the genealogical data in their desktop program, export a new GEDCOM file, and then run Add Media tool on it as part of the import process to have the same image links added everytime they make a new GEDCOM.<br /><br />To use the Add Media Tool, first create a list a media items by filling the fields and clicking the Add Media button for each media item you want included in your GEDCOM.  The \"#pgv_lang[gedcomid]#\" field contains the ID of the GEDCOM record you want the image added to, I100 for example.  In the \"Exernal File\" field, type in the filename of the image you want to use.  Enter the file's extension in the \"#pgv_lang[extension]#\" field.  Use the \"#pgv_lang[highlighted]#\" field to tell whether or not this image is the highlighted or primary image for this individual.  The first highlighted or primary image will be used on charts and highlighted on the individual page next to the person's name.  In the \"#pgv_lang[title]#\" field enter a descriptive title or caption for the image.  Use the \"#pgv_lang[order]#\" field to specify an the order the images should appear on the individual's media tab.  Finally, the \"#pgv_lang[gedcom_file]#\" fields tells which GEDCOM the media item is for.  This allows you to use the tool with multiple GEDCOM files.<br /><br />When the list is completed, click on the \"#pgv_lang[click_to_add_media]#\" button to have the changes stored in the GEDCOM file.  The next time you update your GEDCOM you only need to launch the Add Media Tool and click this button.<br /><br />";
$pgv_lang["change_indi2id_help"]			= "~CHANGE INDIVIDUAL ID TO ....~<br /><br />This tool was designed for users whose Genealogy programs use a different GEDCOM ID for the individuals every time the GEDCOM is exported. For example, the first time the GEDCOM is exported some person's ID is I100 but the next time the GEDCOM is exported the same person's ID is I234.  These changing IDs make it difficult to administer PhpGedView because the ID is how people are referenced.<br /><br />However most genealogy programs also use the RIN or REFN tag to give each person a unique identifier that can be used to reference the individual. This tool will replace all of the individual IDs in the GEDCOM file with the value of another field you specify.  You can choose the RIN or the REFN field to replace the IDs with.<br /><br />";
