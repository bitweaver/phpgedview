INTRODUCTION

Modules are additional software that can be added to the core PhpGedView.
They provide additional functionality not part of the core PhpGedView 
distribution. Some modules integrate very tightly with the PhpGedView
software while others are separate software that loosely links to PhpGedView,
such as the PunBB bulletin board system

Like PhpGedView, modules available for download are Open Source software that
has been produced by people from many countries freely donating their time
and talents to the project, though there is nothing to prevent someone from
developing a source module that is not open source.

CUSTOM MENUS

With PGV version 4.0, there is a new system in place for adding menus to the
main PGV Menu bar.  To do this, create a file called menu.php in your module
folder.  This menu.php should implement an interface which implements the 
getMenu() method. The name of the class must be prefixed by the module name 
and an underscore.  

As an example, if you were building the "acme" module, you would could the file
"acme/menu.php" which would have a class definition similar to the following:
 
class acme_ModuleMenu { 
	function &getMenu() { 
		$menu = new Menu(); 
		return $menu; 
	} 
}
