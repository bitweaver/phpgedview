 /**
 *		Build the tables required for the Dictionary sort
 *
 *		A Dictionary sort is one where all letters with diacritics are considered to be
 *		identical to the base letter (without the mark).  Diacritics become important
 *		only when the two strings (without marks) are identical.
 *
 *		There are two sets of tables, one for the Upper Case version of a UTF8 character
 *		and the other for the lower-case version.  The two tables are not necessarily 
 *		identical.  For example, the Turkish dotless i doesn't exist in the Upper case
 *		table.
 *
 *		Within each set, there are three lists which MUST have a one-to-one relationship.
 *		The "DiacritStrip" list gives the base letter of the corresponding "DiacritWhole" 
 *		character.  
 *		The "DiacritOrder" list assigns a sort value to the diacritic mark of the 
 *		"DiacritWhole" character.  All letters that don't appear in these lists, including 
 *		the base letter from which the one bearing diacritic marks is formed, are assigned 
 *		a sort value of " ".  By using a single letter from the ASCII code chart, we can
 *		have 52 different UTF8 characters all mapping to the same base character.  This will
 *		handle Vietnamese, which is by far the richest language in terms of diacritic marks.
