/**
 * Default Privacy File
 *
 * This is the default privacy.php module that is distributed
 * with phpGedView.  Whenever a gedcom file is added to the PGV system
 * a copy of this file is placed in the <var>$INDEX_DIRECTORY</var> for each gedcom
 * so that each gedcom may use different privacy settings.
 *
 * This privacy module allows you to hide the names and/or details of living people.  Allows
 * authenticated users to view the details of living people.  It also allows Admins to change
 * privacy settings for specific gedcom records or individuals.
 *
 * This privacy file also acts as a module allowing programmers to extend the functionality of
 * the privacy settings or implement a different privacy model for each gedcom. To provide your own
 * privacy module simply implement the functions in this file and configure phpGedview to use your
 * new file.
 *
 * See http://www.phpgedview.net/modules.html for more information on modules in PhpGedView
